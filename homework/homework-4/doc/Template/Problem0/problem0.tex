\secPr{Forming Project Teams (Canvas)}

For the course project, we ask that you form groups of four (we currently have 52 enrolled students in the class). We have made 13 groups on Canvas for you to sign up. You must sign up for a group by the due date of this homework. You are free to sign up immediately, starting now. We will open up a functionality to search for groups on Piazza to help students coordinate to create groups. You can post whether you are looking for more group members or looking for a group. 

You can find the groups in Canvas under "People". There will be a "Project Groups" tab there. Please form a group by the
due date of this homework, April 29th at 5:00PM PST.

The full project description will be included in a separate document, but there are a few things we'd like you to keep in mind when choosing groups. We will ask you to implement both a lookahead controller as well as a controller of your choosing (PID, LQR, MPC, etc). When picking teammates, you should discuss potential ideas for this second controller. While we encourage you to use this second controller as a means to explore new or interesting control techniques, we are not grading you on its complexity (e.g. a non-linear model predictive controller will not necessarily be graded higher than a PID controller, simply because it's more complex). It might also help to post what availability you have to work, as some people are located in different timezones or are working part/full time.
