\secGR{Varying Lookahead Distance with an Oversteering Car}

Here we will examine the
behavior of the poles of the system with an oversteering car and the lookahead controller relative to different
lookahead distances. The state-space form will be
the same here as in \pref{Understanding the Lookahead Controller}, we just need to fill in the proper values for the new vehicle parameters.


Follow the prompts on \GRno{} to create a script to plot the pole locations of this system over a range of lookahead
distances from 0 \si{\m} to 30 \si{\m} in increments of 2 \si{\m}. Set $U_x$ to 30 \si{\m/\s} and \\ $K_{la}$ to 3,500
\si{\N/\m}.
