\secPr{Lookahead Control of an Oversteering Car}

In the previous problem we used a parameter set corresponding to our Volkswagen GTI, Niki. Niki is understeering in the
linear region of handling. The lookahead controller also has some nice properties when used with an oversteering car.
We'll explore those more in the problem.

For the following questions we will be using a hypothetical vehicle parameter set. All of the parameters will be the
same, with the exception of the weight distribution, which will now be 30\% of the weight on the front axle and 70\% of
the weight on the rear axle. This change has been implemented for you in the vehicle params struct on \GRno{}.
