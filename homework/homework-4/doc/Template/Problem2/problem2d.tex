\secGR{Simulating an Oversteering Vehicle}

Let's see how well the predictions from \qrefGS{Oversteering Vehicle Pole Position Analysis} match the system's simulated
response

Follow the prompts in \GRno{} to create a script to simulate the system response of the oversteering vehicle.
Keep $U_x$ at 30 \si{\m/\s} and $\Kla$ at 3,500 \si{\N/\m}. Set the lookahead distance $\xla$ to 25 \si{\m}. 
Simulate the system response for 10 seconds. 
Plot the lateral error and heading error on separate plots as a function of time.
Begin with an initial error of 1 \si{\m}, the vehicle pointing straight along the path, and with $\edot=0$ and $\dpsidot = 0$.

Because we're interested in both lateral error and heading error in this problem, we need to change the output matrix
$C$ slightly, relative to \pref{Understanding the Lookahead Controller}. To get both of these quantities, we'll use:

\al{
    C &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 & 0
    \end{bmatrix}
}

in our state-space object.
