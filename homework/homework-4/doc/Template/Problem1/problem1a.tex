\secGR{Determining an Appropriate Lookahead Gain}

Let's start with the "lookdown" controller ($x_{la} = 0$). Our first step is to determine a gain that seems physically
reasonable.

Follow the prompts in \GRno{} to create a script to calculate $K_{la}$ such that our controller produces a steer 
angle of 3 degrees when the lateral error is one meter and the vehicle is pointed straight along the path.

You are to modify the lookahead gain, \verb!K_la!, to the appropriate value.
