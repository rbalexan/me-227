\secMOGS{Lane Keeping on a Highway}

Using the same controller parameters as \qrefMOGS{Implementing Active Lane Assist and Cruise Control}, simulate the vehicle
tracking a 980 m radius curve from 0 to 20 seconds, and then with the gently undulating highway for the same amount of time.
Start with initial conditions $e = 1$ m, $\dpsi = 0$ rad, $s = 0$ m, $r = 0$ rad/s, $U_y = 0$ m/s, and $U_x = 31 m/s$.

While this road curvature may seem very low, we'll discuss highway design in a future lecture and find that this is a possible value.

Create plots of all six of our system states ($r$, $U_x$, $U_y$, $\dpsi$, $s$, and $e$), 
for each simulation (curved and undulating roads), and submit them to gradescope.

Is this controller able to track the lane effectively without driver intervention in both lane configurations?  Explain your conclusion.
