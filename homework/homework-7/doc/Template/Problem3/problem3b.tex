\secMOGS{Tuning Roll Stiffness}

Let's try to address our handling problems by adjusting roll stiffness. Combination A has the majority of the stiffness
on the rear axle which is not common for passenger vehicles. Let's try the simulation again with Combination B to see if
we do any better. 

Did this correct the problem we saw with Combination A? Did it create another issue, and if so, what was it? Did we make better progress through
the corner (in other words, is our final distance along the path greater at the end of our 14 second simulation time)?

\expect{Run the simulation and answer the questions about the vehicle's behavior. Include the tire force plots.}
