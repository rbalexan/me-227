\secPr{How to Race Through the Hairpin Corner}

In this problem we'll gain some intuition about how we'll manuever through the hairpin corner described below:

\verb!hairpin_corner.mat! contains path information about a 180 degree hairpin turn in the same format we used
in the project. The path consists of a straight of 40m, a clothoid segment 100m long, a 75m radius arc segment with a
length of 135m, another 100m clothoid, and finally another 40m straight. 

The file also contains the desired acceleration and velocity profiles for the corner. These were calculated using a
simple friction circle model, so they aren't necessarily what the vehicle will be able to achieve.

Download and unzip the \verb!hw7.zip! file from Canvas. Open up the \verb!viewPathAndSpeedProfile.m! script 
in the \verb!Problem1/! directory. Run this script
in MATLAB Online or MATLAB Desktop to plot the path and speed profile described in the problem info. You don't need to
add or modify any code here, you just need the plots to answer the following question.
