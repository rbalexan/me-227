\secGR{Plotting Tire Force Curves}

Let's take a moment here to compare the differences in the linear and nonlinear tire models we have implemented so far.

Follow the prompts in \GRno{} to create a script which plots the tire force curves for both the linear and fiala tire
models.
Plot the nonlinear tire curves (lateral force $F_y$ vs. slip angle $\alpha$) for the front and rear tires on the same plot over a
slip angle range of 0 to 12 deg. On the same plot, plot the tire curves for the linear models of the front and rear
tires for a slip angle range of 0 to 4 deg.
