\secGR{Linear Bicycle Model, Constant Speed Assumption}

Follow the prompts in \GRno{} to create a script which simulates the double lane change maneuver captured in the
provided dataset. You should use the linear bicycle model (linear tire model), and assume that speed is constant
throughout the maneuver.

Three experiments were run, one at low speed, one at intermediate speed, and one at high speed.  We have separated all of the data into MATLAB cell arrays, with the first cell corresponding to the low speed test, etc. We have trimmed the dataset to contain only the maneuver in each cell (trimmed out lining the car back up, etc.) Find the average longitudinal speed of the vehicle over the entire maneuver. Set the longitudinal speed in your simulation to this average value.

Plot the yaw rate (in deg/s), lateral velocity (in m/s), and lateral acceleration (in \si{\m/\s^2}) from each
experimental run together with the corresponding simulated values to see how well your model predicts the vehicle's
behavior.
