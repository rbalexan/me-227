\secGR{Simulating a Step Steer at Various Speeds}

Follow the prompts in \GRno{} to create a script to simulate the response of your model with linear tires to a step
steer input of 5 deg (in other words, the initial conditions of the vehicle are travelling straight ahead and the steer
angle is set at 5 deg throughout the simulation) at speeds of 10\si{\m/\s}, 20\si{\m/\s}, and 30\si{\m/\s}.

We have split up the data into cell arrays, with cell 1 corresponding to the 10\si{\m/\s} run, etc. If you're not familiar
with MATLAB cells, you access them using bracket notation like \verb!ux_mps_{1}!. Each cell holds a vector of data
where each element represents one time step. To access a specific time step during a specific experiment you can use
\verb!ux_mps_{1}(20)! which would give you the longitudinal velocity at time step 20 during the 10\si{\m/\s} simulation.
The MATLAB Documentation is very good if you are still unsure about how to use cell arrays.

Plot the simulated yaw rate, $r$, vs. time for all of the speeds on the same plot over the period of 0 to 2 seconds.
Create similar plots for the simulated lateral velocity, $U_y$, and the simulated lateral acceleration, $a_y$.
