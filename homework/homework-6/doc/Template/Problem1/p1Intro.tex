\secPr{Linearization}

In the last homework, you used your intuition about vehicle dynamics to determine signs of feedback gains to stabilize around a drift equilibrium. This week, we are going to learn how we can compute a linearization and use linear control techniques to determine these gains, rather than by inspection.

For all the following problems, consider a drift equilibrium consisting of $r_{eq} = 0.7486$ rad/s, $U_{y,eq} = -8.661$ m/s, $U_{x,eq} = 10.3224$ m/s, $\delta_{eq} = -0.5132$ rad, and $F_{xr,eq} = 7317$ N.

(This is derived from drifting an 18 meter radius path ($\kappa = 1/18)$ with constant sideslip of $-\ang{40}$)
