\secPr{Reflection}

You've completed your project. You've watched your lookahead and group controller executed on a real vehicle. You're officially a vehicle dynamicist!

In the project, you developed feedforward and feedback controllers for steering Niki along a defined path.  Having had a chance to try those controllers on the actual car, you now have additional information about the appropriateness of your design choices beyond what you could gain from simulation.  We want you to reflect on your project experience in light of this new information.  This should be an individual response, not a team response.  If you do find something wrong in your code when answering the first question, however, you can (and should) point this out to your teammates. 

With the data and video from your vehicle testing, let's take a closer look at how your simulated performance compares to the actual performance on the vehicle.
