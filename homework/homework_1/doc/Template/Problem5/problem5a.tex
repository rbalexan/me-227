\secGR{Simulation with a Straight Road}

Now we'll use the simulator built in \textbf{Problem 4} to analyze the controller's performance. We'll begin on a
straight road with no intial heading error ($\Delta\Psi$) and a small path-tracking error ($e$).
The simulation will use parameters from our research vehicle \textbf{Niki} which is a Volkswagen GTI. The simulation is
set to run for 10 seconds. 
After the simulation is complete, plot the lateral error ($e$), the heading error
($\Delta\Psi$), and lookahead error ($e_{la}$) as a function of time. Follow the prompts in \GRno{} to create and run
this simulation.
