\secPr{Simulate Various Road Geometries}

Now we'll use the simulator built in \pref{Building a Simulator} to analyze the controller's performance. Follow the \GRno{} prompts
available in Canvas for each question below. The prompts are copied here for reference. Once the simulations are
working, answer the qualitative questions about each simulation case.
