\secPr{Lateral Velocity and Sideslip Angle}

In the kinematic bicycle model, the lateral velocity at the rear axle is zero under the assumption that the tire velocity is aligned with the tireâ€™s longitudinal axis. The lateral velocity is nonzero at other points along the centerline of the kinematic vehicle, however.
