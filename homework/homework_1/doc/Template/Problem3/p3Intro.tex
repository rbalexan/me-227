\secPr{Tracking a Path}

Letâ€™s start off on a straight road and assume that the vehicle will be close enough to the desired path that small angle
assumptions are valid. Assume that we begin pointing along the centerline of the road ($\Delta \Psi(0) = 0$) but with an offset from our
desired lateral position, ($e(0) \neq 0$).
