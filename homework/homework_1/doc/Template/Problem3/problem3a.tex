\secGS{Lookahead Controller}
A common method for path tracking with vehicles is to use a lookahead controller. This can either look at the projected error some distance ahead on the path or, more commonly, approximate this error as a linear combination of the lateral error and heading error:

\al{
\delta &= K_{la} e_{la}\\
e_{la} &= e + d_{la} \Delta \psi
}

Here $d_{la}$ functions as the “lookahead distance” ahead of the reference point at which the error is calculated. This is exactly the projected error on a straight road and approximately the projected error on a curved road if the curvature is not too large relative to the lookahead distance.

During lecture, we also derived these equations assuming a small heading error and a small curvature:

\al{
\dot{s} &= V\\
\dot{e} &= V\Delta\psi\\
\dot{\Delta\psi} &= \frac{V\delta}L-\kappa V
}

Perform several Laplace transforms assuming small angles, a straight road, and \textbf{constant velocity}. Arrange this into a form where we can look at the response to the lateral error from the initial condition. In other words, calculate the relationship:

\eq{
\frac{E(s)}{e(0)}
}

The denominator of this relationship is the characteristic equation of the system that we can use to design the performance of our tracking controller.

Note: \textit{Where does the initial condition $e(0)$ come from? Remember that initial conditions are a part of the
    Laplace transformation, we just often set them to zero when forming a transfer function. Leave them in your expression
here.}
