\secGR{Simulation with an Undulating Road}

Now we'll run the simulation on an undulating road which curves left and right. Simulate your controller here for the
same gains and initial conditions as \textbf{Question 5.A}.
After the simulation is complete, plot the lateral error ($e$), the heading error
($\Delta\Psi$), and lookahead error ($e_{la}$) as a function of time. 
Follow the prompts in \GRno{} to create and run this simulation.
