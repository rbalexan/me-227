\secGR{Simulation with a Curved Road}

Now we are going to let the road curve. Simulate your controller here for the same gains and initial conditions as
\textbf{Question 5.A} on a curved road with a constant radius of 20 meters. 
After the simulation is complete, plot the lateral error ($e$), the heading error
($\Delta\Psi$), and lookahead error ($e_{la}$) as a function of time. 
Follow the prompts in \GRno{} to create and run this simulation.
