\secPr{Simulating Understeering Vehicles at High Speeds}

\textbf{\color{red} PROBLEM WRITTEN FOR 2020 BUT NOT USED}

In this problem, you will simulate the two vehicles from the last problem at high speeds, such as those they would encounter on the German Autobahn. We hope to see what kind of response the driver will experience and why one might be preferable to the other.
