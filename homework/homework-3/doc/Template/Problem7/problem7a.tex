\secGR{Simulating Steady Corners at Speed}

Following the prompt in \GRno{}, which uses the same simulation you used in Problem 2, simulate each car at each speed for a step steer that will produce a steady-state lateral acceleration of 0.4g.  Plot the yaw rate for both cars on a single plot for each speed (so you have one plot for 20 m/s, one for 40 m/s and one for 60 m/s).
