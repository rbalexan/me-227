\secPr{Weight Distribution and Cornering Stiffness}

Both tire corning stiffness and weight distribution play a role in determining the car’s understeer gradient.  While some properties depend only upon the understeer gradient, other properties of the response depend upon the specific combination of weight balance and cornering stiffnesses that produced that understeer gradient.  Let’s look at how cars with the same understeer gradient can vary in transient performance.
