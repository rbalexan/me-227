\secGS{Understanding Components of the Understeer Gradient}

Let’s see if we can understand the relationships between the physical properties of cornering stiffness and weight distribution and the car’s natural frequency.  First, if we \textbf{keep the understeer gradient constant}, does stiffening the tires increase or decrease natural frequency?  Similarly, for a \textbf{constant understeer gradient}, does placing more of the weight of an understeering car on the front axle increase or decrease the natural frequency?
