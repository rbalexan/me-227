\secGR{Simulation}
One way to think about the handling characteristics of a car is that a better handling car more closely tracks the driverâ€™s steering input.  Follow the prompt in \GRno{} to simulate the response of both of these vehicles to a steep steer of 1 degree at 65mph using the simulation you developed last week with the linear tire model and small angle approximations for 4 seconds and plot the yaw rate.
